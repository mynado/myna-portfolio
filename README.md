## ðŸ’¡ Architecture & Best Practices

This section highlights key professional decisions made during development:

### 1. Visual Hierarchy

The site utilizes a clear semantic and visual hierarchy enforced entirely by **Tailwind utility classes** applied directly to the components. This approach eliminates unused CSS and keeps the stylesheet clean.

- **`<h1>` (Name)**: `text-5xl md:text-7xl font-extrabold`
- **`<h2>` (Title/Sections)**: `text-2xl md:text-4xl font-semibold`

### 2. Content Management

All static site content (text, project details, skills) is managed in a dedicated **TypeScript data file** (`src/data/portfolio-data.ts`). This ensures a clean **separation of concerns** between data and presentation.

### 3. Tooling Configuration

The entire environment is configured for efficiency:

- **Styling:** Uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with a **CSS-first configuration** (no `tailwind.config.js`).
- **Linting:** ESLint is configured with strict **`recommended-type-checked`** TypeScript rules, enforcing the highest level of code quality.
